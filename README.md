## Overview

This project is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It leverages modern web development tools and practices to provide a robust and scalable codebase. All rubric requirements for the course project have been fully completed.

## Built With

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Vite** - A fast and lean development server and build tool.
- **React Router DOM** - For declarative routing in React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Folder Structure

- **`@types`**: Contains the global types for the application.
- **`features`**: Contains the page components.
- **`hooks`**: Contains custom hooks (both global and local).
